"I'm a newb studying computer science. Hopefully one day I will be 
a pro programmer. Ideally I would love to develop applications for cycling
for Google glasses or Garmin, but would be content with most any Software 
development job or website design postition.

I have a degree in Architecture already and have to say that I like computer
science a lot more. I don't regret my degree as I feel I picked up alot of
valuble skills, i.e. I have tons of presentation and design / development
experience. In the end, I feel that I will be happier programming and at 
being able to design software and applications that deal with my passion - 
Cycling. That's enough about me I guess"
