We had a great turnout with 60 people competing at this year's
local University of Arizona ACM Programming Contest.

Come to this week's ACM meeting to talk to fellow competitors about those
problems that had you banging your head against the wall, or the ones that you
had a particularly clever solution to.  We have the source code for the
official solutions, but its always much more interesting to see how our peers
approached the problems.

In case you missed the competition, or lost your problem statements, the
problems can be seen below:
